Sanic
=================================

Sanic is a Flask-like Python 3.5+ web server that's written to go fast.  It's based on the work done by the amazing folks at magicstack, and was inspired by `this article <https://magic.io/blog/uvloop-blazing-fast-python-networking/>`_.

On top of being Flask-like, Sanic supports async request handlers.  This means you can use the new shiny async/await syntax from Python 3.5, making your code non-blocking and speedy.

Sanic is developed `on GitHub <https://github.com/channelcat/sanic/>`_. Contributions are welcome!

Sanic aspires to be simple
